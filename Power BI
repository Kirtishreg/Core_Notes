Power BI is a business analytics and data visualization tool from Microsoft that enables users to:

Connect to various data sources
Transform and model data
Create interactive dashboards and reports
Share insights across organizations

It is a core tool in the data engineering and BI stack—especially in Azure ecosystems—used to convert raw data into actionable insights.

 Example Workflow:
Data Ingestion
Source: SQL Server, Azure Synapse, Excel, APIs, SharePoint, etc.
Power BI connects directly or via Azure Data Factory/Dataflows.

Data Preparation
Use Power Query (ETL tool in Power BI) to clean, filter, merge, and transform data.

Modeling
Create relationships between tables, define KPIs, build calculated columns using DAX.

Visualization
Drag-and-drop interface for building:

Bar/line charts
Maps
Gauges
Tables
Slicers and filters
Publishing & Sharing
Publish to Power BI Service
Share dashboards via links, embed in Teams, or schedule email reports
Automation & Refresh
Set up data refresh schedules
Use Power BI Gateway to keep on-prem data up-to-date in the cloud

Power BI Data Sources
Cloud: Azure Synapse, BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift
Databases: SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle
Files: Excel, CSV, JSON, XML
APIs: REST, OData, SharePoint
Services: Salesforce, Google Analytics, Dynamics 365

CHARTS: 
🟦 1. Bar / Column Chart
✅ Use Case: Compare categories (e.g., sales by product)
🛠 Steps:
Load your data (e.g., Product and Sales columns).
Drag a bar chart from the Visualizations pane.
Drag Product Name to Axis.
Drag Sales to Values.
Sort by value if needed (click the ellipsis in top-right corner).
Format colors, axis labels, and tooltips as desired.

📈 2. Line Chart
✅ Use Case: Show trends over time (e.g., revenue over months)
🛠 Steps:
Use a dataset with date and value columns (e.g., OrderDate, Revenue).
Insert a Line Chart.
Drag OrderDate to Axis (use hierarchy: year, month).
Drag Revenue to Values.
Use filters to limit to a specific year or region.
Enable data labels for clarity.

📊 3. Pie / Donut Chart
✅ Use Case: Show proportion (e.g., sales share by region)
🛠 Steps:
Add a Pie Chart from the pane.
Drag Region to Legend.
Drag Sales to Values.
Choose whether to display labels, percentages, or values.
Use color settings to differentiate slices.
🔁 Donut Chart: Similar steps—just use the donut variant.

📍 4. Map (Filled or Bubble)
✅ Use Case: Geospatial analysis (e.g., customers by city)
🛠 Steps:
Ensure you have geographic fields (like Country, City, or Coordinates).
Add a Map or Filled Map visual.
Drag Location (e.g., City) to Location field.
Drag a metric (e.g., Sales) to Size or Values.
Format map style (light, dark, road view).

💡 5. Card (KPI or Single Value)
✅ Use Case: Show single metric (e.g., Total Profit)
🛠 Steps:
Add a Card Visual.
Drag a measure like SUM(Profit) into it.
Add conditional formatting or data labels as needed.
Use DAX to create custom KPIs like:
TotalProfit = SUM(Sales[Profit])

📊 6. Table / Matrix
✅ Use Case: Show detailed data (e.g., revenue by category and region)
🛠 Steps:
Choose Table or Matrix visual.
Drag multiple fields (Category, Region, Sales) to Rows and Values.
Use conditional formatting for highlights (top performers, red/yellow/green).
Enable subtotals and row expansion in Matrix view.

📐 7. Gauge / KPI
✅ Use Case: Show progress toward a goal
🛠 Steps for Gauge:
Insert a Gauge Visual.
Drag a measure like Total Sales to Value.
Set Min, Target, and Max values (can use DAX).
SalesTarget = 1000000
Steps for KPI:
Use KPI Visual.
Set Indicator = Total Sales.
Set Target = Sales Target measure.
Add Trend Axis (e.g., Order Date) for context.

📦 8. Slicer
✅ Use Case: Add interactivity (e.g., filter reports by region or date)
🛠 Steps:
Insert a Slicer visual.
Drag a field like Region or OrderDate to it.
Choose dropdown, list, or between-slider view.
Test by selecting values—other visuals will update accordingly.
