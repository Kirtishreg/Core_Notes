Databricks is a cloud-based data platform designed to help data teams collaborate on large-scale data engineering, data science, machine learning, and analytics. 
It was founded by the creators of Apache Spark and makes it much easier to run and scale Spark-based workloads in the cloud.

| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Managed Spark**   | No need to install or manage Apache Spark clusters ‚Äî Databricks manages the infrastructure.                 |
| **Notebooks**       | Interactive, collaborative notebooks that support **PySpark**, **SQL**, **Scala**, **R**, and **Markdown**. |
| **Data Lakehouse**  | Combines features of a data lake and a data warehouse using the **Delta Lake** format.                      |
| **Auto Scaling**    | Automatically scales clusters up or down based on load.                                                     |
| **Job Scheduling**  | Create, schedule, and monitor data pipelines and jobs.                                                      |
| **ML & AI Support** | Built-in tools for model training, hyperparameter tuning, and experiment tracking (MLflow).                 |
| **Integrations**    | Integrates with AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Kafka, Snowflake, Power BI, Tableau, and more.                    |


üîó Databricks Supports Multiple Languages
PySpark (Python API for Spark)
Scala (native Spark language)
SQL (for querying and transformations)
R (data science & statistical computing)

üí° Common Use Cases
ETL/Data Engineering: Clean and transform raw data into analytics-ready formats.
Machine Learning: Train and deploy ML models at scale.
Business Intelligence: Query large datasets using SQL and visualize insights.
Real-time Analytics: Process streaming data (e.g., IoT, logs) in near real-time.

üõ†Ô∏è Example Workflow in Databricks
Ingest raw data from a cloud storage bucket (e.g., S3, Azure Data Lake).
Write a PySpark script to clean and transform the data.
Store results in a Delta Lake table.
Use SQL notebooks to generate reports.
Train an ML model using Databricks ML and track experiments with MLflow.
