Pandas is a Python library. Pandas is used to analyze data.
It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data.
Pandas allows us to analyze big data and make conclusions based on statistical theories.
Pandas can clean messy data sets, and make them readable and relevant. Relevant data is very important in data science.
Pandas are also able to delete rows that are not relevant, or contains wrong values, like empty or NULL values. This is called cleaning the data.

import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
print(df.to_string()) 

import pandas
mydataset = {
  'cars': ["BMW", "Volvo", "Ford"],
  'passings': [3, 7, 2]
}
myvar = pandas.DataFrame(mydataset)
print(myvar)

Pandas Series: A Pandas Series is like a column in a table. It is a one-dimensional array holding data of any type.
import pandas as pd
a = [1, 7, 2]
myvar = pd.Series(a)
print(myvar)
